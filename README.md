# Groupify

## Workgroups sorter: overview

This is my first personal project using React, which is useful for creating workgroups. Employees are set one by one into a state, and then they distributed into three different groups using the sort() method. Typically, task cards during the night shift are divided into wings, fuselaje and landing gear, and that's why adding more groups is no longer an option by now.
